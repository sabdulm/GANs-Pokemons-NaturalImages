    "\n",
    "   * Develop a GAN model using Pytorch or TensorFlow that can generate images. What we aim to observe is how a GAN works? How long does it take for a GAN to generate outputs that resemble the input data? Is there a way to test the accuracy/precision of a GAN? To train the model the following datasets will be used:\n",
    "        * MNIST Dataset\n",

    "        * In this paper, the authors come up with a method that is able to produce a series of images given an input sentence. The images generated are basically visually describing what the input sentence had said. As an input  to the model, they have created various text embeddings and relevant images.\n",
    "        * If time permits, create a new dataset with the relevant images and text embeddings for the to use.\n",
    "        * We aim to understand how exactly does a GAN take textual data as input and provide image data as output. Furthermore, how realistic is the \"Text to Photo-realistic Image Synthesis\" by creating new input datasets."
